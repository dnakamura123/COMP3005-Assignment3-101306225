1) install requirments
    - PostgresSQL 17
    - Java JDK 17+
    - Maven
2) Creating the Database:
    - To compile the enter "mvn clean compile" in the terminal using bash
    - Before running the code in the terminal(using git bash) enter the following line of code "./restart_db.sh" as this will generate the correct database when runnin the code and can refresh it at any time. 
    - Once the new database is created, entering "./run_main.sh" will run the program and provide a list of options, 0. to exit, 1. to add a new student to the database, 2. updating a student's current email, 3. delete a student in the database, or 4. to view all students; as you go through options 1-3 it will list out questions that will complete the specific feature.
